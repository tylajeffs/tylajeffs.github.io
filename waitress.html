                <p class="indent">I worked as a waitress for a long time, and learned all the tricks to getting good tips! Because I only made $3.25 an hour, I had to figure out how to get the best tips - and now I'm going to share them with you!</p>

                <h2>#1 - Write "Thank You!" on the Check </h2>
                
                <div class="blog-img">
                    
                    <img class="full-width" src="images/thanks.jpg" alt="thanks">
                    
                </div>
                
                
                
                <div class="blog-text">
                    
                    <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>Thank You Goes a Long Way</i></h4>
                    
                    <p class="indent">This is the number one practice that had me making nearly twice as much as my other coworkers when I was waitressing. <i>Write "Thank You" at the bottom of the check!</i> I always drew a little smiley face or heart as well, just for fun.</p>
                    
                    <p class="indent">This practice actually has a base in psychology. When you write thank you on the check, people feel obligated to tip you because you've already thanked them for it. This combined with the other tricks in this post are sure to get you an increase in tips.</p>

                    <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>Overflow With Optimism!</i></h4>
                    
                    <p class="indent">While serving, make sure you are smiling! Be geniune, and put yourself in the mindset of truly wanting to help people. When you become an optimistic problem solver, people automatically like you better. People gravitate toward positivity, and most have had enough experiences with bad waiters/waitresses that having an exceptional one (you!) will brighten their day, and they'll reward you for it with a good tip.  </p>

                    <p class="indent">This one might seem a little strange, but it absolutely works! <i>ALWAYS</i> prompt customers to buy more - just don't be pushy about it. The bigger the check, the bigger the tip (and it's not much more work for you!). Here are some great phrases to guide customers to spend more money and tip you better!</p>
