                <p class="indent">Every college student could use some extra cash. Here's 10 easy ways to make an extra $20.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <br>
            
            <div>
                
                <div class="blog-img">

                <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>#1 - Ebay Arbitrage</i></h4>
                
                <p class="blog-text">Find free or cheap things on craigslist to buy, and then turn around and sell them for a profit on Ebay. Often, people on craigslist either don't know what their stuff is worth or they just want it gone fast, meaning you can get it for cheap or even free, then resell it to make a profit.</p>
                
                <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>#2 - Mow Lawns</i></h4>
                
                <p class="blog-text">This one is pretty common and self explanatory. Knock doors and see if anyone wants any yardwork done, and then negotiate a price! Easy $20.</p>
                
                <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>#3 - Sell Baked Goods</i></h4>
                
                <p class="blog-text">If you are good at baking, this is the one for you! Whip up a batch of cookies or brownies or other baked good and sell them to your friends and family. If you sell them for a $1 eahc, you only need to sell one batch to have $20.</p>
                
                <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>#4 - Refinish Furniture</i></h4>
                
                <p class="blog-text">This is one of my personal favorites, but it does require some skill and tools. Similar to Ebay Arbitrage, find old furniture on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, fix it up, and then resell it for a profit. With large items, you can upsell quite a bit. $100 anyone?</p>
                
                <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>#5 - Babysitting</i></h4>
                
                <p class="blog-text">Babysitting is another one of my go-to's. If you are good with kids, this is a great option! Parents are always in need of a break, and if you offer to babysit one weekend, chances are they will take you up on it. You can expect to be paid $10 an hour, so you only need to babysit for 2 hour to get an extra $20.</p>
                
                <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>#6 - Pancake Stand</i></h4>
                
                <p class="blog-text">This is a super fun option! Instead of having a lemonade stand, make a pancake stand. Sell pancakes to your friends and family and anyone else who comes along. This would be great to do on a college campus.</p>
                
                <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>#7 - House Cleaning</i></h4>
                
                <p class="blog-text">House cleaning is a great option to make a little extra cash. Usually large families will jump on the opportunity to have someone else take care of all the cleaning chores they've been procrastinating.</p>
                
                <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>#8 - Tutoring</i></h4>
                
                <p class="blog-text">There is a lot of money to be made in tutoring. If you are good at any subject in school, you can offer to tutor others in that subject. Generally, you can charge $20 an hour, and if you set up weekly sessions, you'll have an extra $20 every week.</p>
                
                <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>#9 - Paint House Numbers</i></h4>
                
                <p class="blog-text">This is one idea I've been dying to try. Get some white, reflective, glow in the dark paint from a home improvement store and some stencils of numbers 0-9. Knock doors and ask people if you can paint their house number on the curb. If they say yes, you can decide to do it for free and have them tip you, or you decide on a price ($5?). Either way, if you do a whole neighborhood you could end up with a lot of extra cash.</p>
                
                <h4 class="middle blog-heading"><i>#10 - Sell Old Gift Cards</i></h4>
                
                <p class="blog-text">This is one idea I haven't tried yet, but seems super profitable! Many times, people give gift cards on holidays, and I have definitely gotten my share of gift cards I will never use. The great news is, you can turn around and sell them! You can sell them to friends or family for a discount, or find a site online to sell them on.</p>
